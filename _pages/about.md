I am currently a PhD Candidate in the [Wania Group](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/wania/) at the University of Toronto. My research focuses on how we can measure, predict, and apply the octanol-air partition ratio (*K*<sub>OA</sub>) and its temperature dependence. I also dabble a a little bit in science policy!

My interest in environmental fate and modelling began during my undergraduate years at Trent University. I went on to obtain a  Master's of Science degree in Chemistry at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Prof. Frank Wania in 2015, before becoming a PhD student.

In 2018, I co-founded the [Toronto Science Policy Network](https://tspn.ca) (TSPN), a student group at the University of Toronto, and later served as the Vice-President and President. I have now taken on an advisory role to the executive committee and leadership team. I have also helped with the #VoteScience campaign during the 2019 and 2021 federal elections, by designing infographics and postcards.
