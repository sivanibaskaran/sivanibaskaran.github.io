I am currently a PhD Candidate in the [Wania Group](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/wania/) at the University of Toronto. My research focuses on how we can measure, predict, and apply the octanol-air partition ratio (*K*~OA~) and its temperature dependence. I also dabble a a little bit in science policy!
