I am an environmental chemist by training and dabble a little a little bit in science policy. Currently I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute in Oslo where I focus on identifying persistent and mobile (PM) substances in the environment as part of the [WP5 of the ZeroPM project,](https://zeropm.eu/wp5-substance-grouping/), on substance grouping.

My interest in environmental fate and modelling began during my undergraduate years at Trent University. I went on to obtain a  Master's of Science degree in Chemistry at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Prof. Frank Wania in 2015, before starting my journey as a PhD student at the University of Toronto.

In August 2023, I completed my PhD at the University of Toronto working with Prof. Frank Wania. My PhD focused on how we can measure, predict, and apply the octanol-air partition ratio (*K*<sub>OA</sub>) and its temperature dependence. During my PhD, I held over 15 different service appointments with various student unions, environmental, health, and safety committees, conference committees, student groups, and other organizing committees such as the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry.

In 2018, I co-founded the [Toronto Science Policy Network](https://tspn.ca) (TSPN), a student group at the University of Toronto, and later served as the Vice-President and President. I have now taken on an advisory role to the executive committee and leadership team. I have also helped with the #VoteScience campaign during the 2019 and 2021 federal elections, by designing infographics and postcards. I am currently helping with the [#SupportOurScience](http://supportourscience.ca/) and with developing a Canada-wide next generation science policy network, SciPolCanada.
