My scientific interests lay in how chemicals move in our environment including how they move between our water systems, the air we breathe, and the food we eat. I am interested in how we can use physical-chemical properties, property estimation tools, and chemical exposure and bioaccumulation modelling to describe and predict the environmental fate and transport of chemicals in our environment and assess the relative hazard and risk of chemicals in our environment. 

During my PhD I worked with Prof. Frank Wania and Ying Duan Lei to study the octanol-air partition ratio - how's its measured, estimated, its temperature dependence and application in environmental chemistry. Prior to that, I completed a MSc with Prof. Wania exploring how the bioegenergetics of lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) in different ecosystems can alter their bioaccumulation potential of persistent organic pollutants.

I am currently working on identifying persistent and mobile substances in the global chemical inventory based on their physical-chemical properties. This work is part of the [ZeroPM](http://zeropm.eu]) project.
