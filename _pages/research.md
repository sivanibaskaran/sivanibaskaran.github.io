My scientific interests lay in how chemicals move in our environment between our water systems, the air we breathe, the and food we eat. I am interested in how we can use physical-chemical properties, property estimation tools, and chemical exposure and bioaccumulation modelling to describe and predict the environmental fate and transport of chemicals in our environment and assess the relative hazard and risk of chemicals in our environment.
